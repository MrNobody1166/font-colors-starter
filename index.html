      Why hello there! Since you are here, we might as well talk about my favorite subject - Minecraft. Minecraft is a blocky sandbox video game made by a Swedish man named Markus "Notch" Personn in 2009 as part of the company Mojang. It was released in Alpha, and was rather popular. This version is known today as classic, and you can visit it at classic.minecraft.net. <br />
      In 2010, Minecraft became infinite, and grew in popularity. More features were added, and it started to gather a small team of developers. <br />
      In 2011, Minecraft built up to version 1.0, the first official release. It was officially released at the first Minecon (Minecraft Convention), hosted by Lydia Winters. <br />
      In the years following, Minecraft became well known for it's infinite possibilities, and released many versions with lots of new features. <br />
      In 2014, Microsoft bought Mojang for two billion US dollars, and Markus Personn left the company, as well as the original founders, who signed over the rights.<br />
      In the years following, under the leadership of Microsoft and lead developer Jens "jeb_" Bergensten, Minecraft became even more popular.
      And finally, in 2019, Minecraft had it's 10th anniversary, and passed Tetris in sales. <br />
      In conclusion, Minecraft is amazing! Thanks for reading!
